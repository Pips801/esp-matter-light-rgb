# esp-matter-light-rgb
ESP-Matter application (with thread) for RGB light control on the ESP32c6

# Purpose

This project is a modified copy of the `espressif/esp-matter/examples/light` project. I wanted to understand features and clusters in code, and was able to figure out how to add an additional Hue and Saturation Feature to the Color Control Cluster.
